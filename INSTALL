Instructions for installation (on debian based systems)
* This is assuming that python 2.7 would be installed on debian based systems by default. 
* Essentials to be installed - mysql-server (v 5.5/5.6), pip, virtualenv, git, python-dev. This can be done through apt-get.
`sudo apt-get install mysql-server python-pip python-virtualenv git python-dev`
* apt-get installation of mysql would probably prompt for setting the root password. If needed, after the installation a new user can be created.
* Clone this repository using git clone <link to repo> and browse to the project directory.
* Start virtual env for the directory using `virtualenv env`
* Activate virtual env using `source env/bin/activate`
* Install requirements using `pip install -r requirements.pip`. This will install django along with other required libraries.
* Create config.py using `cp blog/config.tmp blog/config.py`
* Next, create a database `echo "CREATE DATABASE <databasename>" | mysql -u <username> -p`
* Modify config.py with the database details - databasename, username, password. If mysql installed on the same system, don't modify the host and port values.
* Run `python manage.py migrate`
* Run `python manage.py runserver 8001`. This will run the test python server at port 8001
